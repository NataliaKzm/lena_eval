## Going from eaf's to rttm's (ACLEW) -- NOT FINISHED, GET MARVIN'S INPUT

https://github.com/srvk/DiViMe/blob/master/utils/adjust_timestamps.py

or perhaps

https://github.com/srvk/DiViMe/blob/master/utils/eafAAS2rttm_folder.sh


## Going from textgrid to rttm's (TSI) NEED TO FINISH THIS

This chunk takes Camila's text grids, removes the tiers that do not contain speech, corrects some typos and inconsistencies, and generates one rttm per annotated 1-minute file.

https://github.com/aclew/utils/blob/master/textgrid2rttm.py

Then, we need to change the naming convention from the one that had child_sib_mother to just child:

https://github.com/srvk/DiViMe/blob/master/utils/change_tsi_lena_names.py

Finally, it turns out that whatever technique we used before did not create empty rttms for files with no speech. The following code generated them using the rttms from the divime paper.

```{bash make_empty,eval=F}

for j in /Users/acristia/Documents/gitrepos/divime_brm/yunnew/*.rttm ; do
   name=$(basename $j)
   name=`echo $name | sed "s/_M..//"`
   if test -f "/Users/acristia/Documents/gitrepos/lena_eval/LENA_eval_201906/gold/$name" ; then
       echo "$name exists"
    else
       touch  /Users/acristia/Documents/gitrepos/lena_eval/LENA_eval_201906/gold/$name
       echo "$name created"
    fi
done
```

## Going from LENA's .its to rttm's: tsi


For the tsi files, took from shared folder with Camila called tsi_its, containing a lot more its than the ones we have annotation for, and sitting on top of that folder (ie above its subfolder) I did the following to get the right name:

```{bash rename-tsi,eval=F}
grep "LENA" tsi_key_info.csv | while read -r line; do itsname=`echo $line | cut -f 5 -d ","` ; newname=`echo $line | cut -f 11 -d ","` ;  cp its/$itsname.its ${newname}.its ; done
```

Notice there is one file for C18 that is supposed to have a LENA file, but the its is missing from the shared folder. We donÂ´t have annotation for a second C18 day however. So it may be an error and there is in fact not a second LENA file for this child.

Then move the newly named its files into lena/TSI and run the following is used to generate a huge rttm that has the whole day.

```{bash its2rttm,eval=F}
./its2rttm.sh lena/TSI/
```

Finally, for TSI, we use the golds to generate the corresponding sections in LENA's rttms.

```{bash gold2shortlena,eval=F}
for j in gold/*.rttm ; do mv $j $j.unsorted ; done
for j in gold/*.rttm.unsorted ; do sorted=`echo $j | sed "s/.unsorted//"`  ; awk  '{printf("%s %s %s %.2f %.2f %s %s %s %s %s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10,$11)}' $j |  sort -n -k4 > $sorted ; done

for j in lena/*.rttm ; do mv $j $j.unsorted ; done
for j in lena/*.rttm.unsorted ; do sorted=`echo $j | sed "s/.unsorted//"` ; sort -n -k4 $j > $sorted ; done

./extract_tsi.sh
 
```


Error: 
awk: fatal: cannot open file `lena/TSI/C18_20170718.rttm' for reading (No such file or directory)

arises due to this file:
gold/oldname/C18_C17_M11_20170718_45240.rttm
C18 20170718 45240

Moved that file and the other C18 20170718 file into a folder called gives_error

Then script freezes when starting the second C24 day? No, is it perhaps due to C24_C23_M14_20170712_41640.rttm? Moved this file to gives error.

fatal: cannot open file `lena/TSI/C24_20170719.rttm'

moved all C24 second day to gives_error folder

## Going from LENA's .its to rttm's: ACLEW

I'm not sure how those three steps were done for the ACLEW files. The next script used the wav files' names, generated in "Going from eaf's to rttm's", to extract sections of the .its files for ACLEW.


```{bash cutlena,eval=F}
python cut_lena.py
 
```


## Create csv's with pyannote.metrics

```{bash pyannote, eval=F}

source activate pyannote-lena 

# pip install pyannote-metrics # only needed first time

# After having activated pyannote-lena environment
## Map the labels
## You can change the mapping in labels_mapper.py
## The -o option indicates if overlapping classes need to be aggregated as being "OVL"

rm -r -f */mapped*/
python labels_mapper.py -p lena/ -m lena_sil #all the far categories go to silence
mv lena/mapped lena/mapped_sil
python labels_mapper.py -p lena/ -m lena_far #all the far categories go to silence
mv lena/mapped lena/mapped_far

python labels_mapper.py -p gold/ -m gold -o

## Evaluate lena performances (should not be run in the frontnode)
# With -t being the task (identification, diarization or detection)
# -m being the list of metrics
python compute_metrics.py -ref gold/mapped/ -hyp lena/mapped_sil/ -t diarization -m diaer coverage homogeneity completeness purity


```

## Generate frame-based rttms

These contain the same info as the lena and gold rttms, but each line represents a 100 ms frame, and all frames are accounted for (whereas in standard rttms silence is not tagged). The following lines must be ran on a terminal (because they give an error here, not sure why).

```{bash runpy, eval=F}
rm -r -f */frame/
python frame_cutter.py --i lena/mapped_far/
mkdir lena/frame/
mv lena/mapped_far/*_cutted.rttm lena/frame/
wc -l lena/frame/*.rttm

python frame_cutter.py --i gold/mapped/
mkdir gold/frame/
mv gold/mapped/*_cutted.rttm gold/frame/
wc -l gold/frame/*.rttm

```

## Generate CTC & CVC

Logic is:

- Do the following for the LENA & Gold and pair the output values
- Read in each rttm
- Sort it so that it's ordered in time
- Get CHI's CVC
- Label vocs as counting towards CTC or not, then sum the yes's

```{r cvtc}
# options(warn=2) for debugging, then options(warn=1)

lena_folder="lena/mapped_far/"
gold_folder="gold/mapped/"

filenames = list.files(lena_folder, pattern = "*.rttm$")

    lena_path = paste(lena_folder, filename, sep="/")
    gold_path = paste(gold_folder, filename, sep="/")
    
# The LENA always exist, but it may be empty if the whole file is silence, according to LENA
