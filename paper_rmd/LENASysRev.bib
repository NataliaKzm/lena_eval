abstract = {The purpose of this research was to replicate and extend some of the findings of Hart and Risley using automatic speech processing instead of human transcription of language samples. The long-term goal of this work is to make the current approach to speech processing possible by researchers and clinicians working on a daily basis with families and young children. Twelve hour-long, digital audio recordings were obtained repeatedly in the homes of middle to upper SES families for a sample of typically developing infants and toddlers (N = 30). These recordings were processed automatically using a measurement framework based on the work of Hart and Risley. Like Hart and Risley, the current findings indicated vast differences in individual children's home language environments (i.e., adult word count), children's vocalizations, and conversational turns. Automated processing compared favorably to the original Hart and Risley estimates that were based on transcription. Adding to Hart and Risley's findings were n...},

abstract = {Infants differ substantially in their rates of language growth, and slow growth predicts later academic difficulties. In this study, we explored how the amount of speech directed to infants in Spanish-speaking families low in socioeconomic status influenced the development of children's skill in real-time language processing and vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants' language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate lang...},

abstract = "We describe in this paper the experiences of the Johns Hopkins University team during the inaugural DIHARD diarization evaluation. This new task provided microphone recordings in a variety of difficult conditions and challenged researchers to fully consider all speaker activity, without the currently typical practices of unscored collars or ignored overlapping speaker segments. This paper explores several key aspects of currently state-of-the-art diarization methods, such as training data selection, signal bandwidth for feature extraction, representations of speech segments (i-vector versus x-vector), and domain-adaptive processing. In the end, our best system clustered x-vector embeddings trained on wideband microphone data followed by Variational-Bayesian refinement, and a speech activity detector specifically trained for this task with in-domain data was found to be the best performing. After presenting these decisions and their final result, we discuss lessons learned and remaining challenges within the lens of this new approach to diarization performance measurement.",
