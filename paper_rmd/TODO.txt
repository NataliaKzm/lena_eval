some of the apostrophes in  LENA®’'s get messed up - how can this be fixed?
#eb: ugh this is a papaja thing i think; probably easiest to search and replace in the tex at the end? we should file an issue

WHILE IT IS BEING REVIEWED
create transparent treatment chain for AWC

create and upload recipe in divime to do the validation exactly as in this paper

add evaluation of voc versus nonvoc

CVC is only over VOC regions --> extract them and recalculate 

also extract the actual counts from lena

is CTC for any CHN or only VOC ones?

change pyannote evaluation to identification task

create supplementary materials which contain the rmd + instructions for reknitting & a sup mat rmd+pdf that contains the full output of all regressions


AFTER IT COMES BACK:
consider consolidating some repetitive text (e.g. ARE, RER, ARER) into tables

create proper links for table and figure numbering with @ref, @tab etc.

improve Fig 1

consider adding a table with output from the regressions

recalculate AWC results without the French kid (1499)
