all the apostrophes in LENA^TM^'s get messed up - how can this be fixed?
#eb: ugh this is a papaja thing i think; probably easiest to search and replace in the tex at the end? we should file an issue

make sure AC agrees with EBs recommended reviewers and that cover letter meets 
BRM requirements

AFTER IT COMES BACK:
create proper links for table and figure numbering with @ref, @tab etc.

add evaluation of voc versus nonvoc

CVC is only over VOC regions --> extract them and recalculate 

also extract the actual counts from lena

is CTC for any CHN or only VOC ones?

improve Fig 1

change pyannote evaluation to identification task

create transparent treatment chain for AWC

recalculate AWC results without the French kid (1499)

create and upload recipe in divime to do the validation exactly as in this paper
