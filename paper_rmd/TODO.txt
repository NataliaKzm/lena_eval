all the apostrophes in LENA^TM^'s get messed up - how can this be fixed?
#eb: looks fixed!

add evaluation of voc versus nonvoc

CVC is only over VOC regions --> extract them and recalculate 

also extract the actual counts from lena

is CTC for any CHN or only VOC ones?

improve Fig 1

change pyannote evaluation to identification task

create transparent treatment chain for AWC

recalculate AWC results without the French kid (1499)

create and upload recipe in divime to do the validation exactly as in this paper
