add evaluation of voc versus nonvoc
CVC is only over VOC regions --> extract them and recalculate 
also extract the actual counts from lena
is CTC for any CHN or only VOC ones?
improve Fig 1
change pyannote evaluation to identification task
create transparent treatment chain for AWC
recalculate AWC results without the French kid (1499)
change how AWC is done, over clip rather than utterances
recalculate total speech duration for all corpora
create recipe in divime to do the validation exactly as in this paper
